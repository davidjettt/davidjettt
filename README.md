My name is David! I am a creative, detail-oriented developer. I
love problem solving and use this to fuel my passion for designing
functional and elegant web applications. I enjoy challenges and have a
curiosity and desire to always build my knowledge. Some of my hobbies
besides coding include working out at the gym, snowboarding, traveling,
photography, and editing photos.
